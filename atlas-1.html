        What you are actually shaping:
        <span class="geom">Geometry of Meaning</span>
      </h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Atlas is built on the idea that meaning is not a list.
        Meaning has shape.
      </p>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-top:10px">
        The <span class="geom">Geometry of Meaning</span> is the spatial relationship
        between tags in the XY field.  
        Their distances, alignments, and heat values create a structure —
        and images settle according to that structure.
      </p>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-top:10px">
        When tags move, the geometry changes.
        When heat shifts, the geometry warps.
        When anchor images are added, the geometry bends toward them.
      </p>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-top:10px">
        Atlas doesn’t just filter images.
        It resolves equilibrium inside a living geometric system.

      <h2>Atlas 2D</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        A streamlined planar version of Atlas focused purely on the
        <span class="geom">Geometry of Meaning</span> —
        no sphere, no depth layers — just the raw field.
      </p>

        Atlas 2D — Coming Soon
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:12px; color:var(--muted2); font-size:13px;">
        Clean. Fast. Pure field interaction.
